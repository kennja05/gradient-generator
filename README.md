Linear Gradient Generator
=========================

**Background**

Linear Gradient is a CSS function which [creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line. Its result is an object of the <gradient> data type, which is a special kind of <image>.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient) There are essentially countless variations of color gradients that can be created using this technique - most random color combinations will not look very good, but occasionally we can stumble upon a random color combination that happens to look good together. 
  
**Usage**

This application randomly generates linear gradients, and allows users to copy the code used for those gradients directly to their clipboard. Additionally the user can also create their own customized linear gradient and see a preview of what it would look like if they were to use those colors on their own page. 

**Running Locally**

To run the program locally, simply clone the repo and then run the command ```npm i && npm start```
